# Hackaprinter
A compact, foldable 3d printer designed for usage at Hackathons and travel events, the hackaprinter will be designed to fold into a low profile briefcase, without sacrificing the standard features of a FDM Printer
## Design Conventions
I want the entire thing to fit in a decently small footprint, so I'm going to be using a cartesian printer, shown below.

The reason this is comes mostly down to reliability, Delta printers tend to struggle in high risk environments, and open source parts can be scarce for them, especially for a low budget.

Now, I'm taking inspiration from the [Bambu A1 mini](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini?id=579551171554607120&skr=yes&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21217723580&gclid=CjwKCAjwo4rCBhAbEiwAxhJlCavDCgHhe0NZr2nbKM44qUBexoVb0NvLki5GAZkZdg-Ft3dme-yg3BoCgUgQAvD_BwE) with this, specifically the cantilevered design of the printhead and the easily defined work envelope.

I decided, for the initial test run, I would focus on 3 core goals to aspire towards:

1. Keeping the smallest possible envelope, while not sacrificing performance.
2. Keeping room for future expansion by not bottlenecking the system excessively.
3. Making the design as low cost as possible.
